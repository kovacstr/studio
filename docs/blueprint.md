- Accent color: A vibrant orange (#FF9F57) complements the purple and can be used for calls to action.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, creating a modern and readable interface, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, ensuring readability for questionnaire items and descriptions.
- Use custom, youthful icons for different sections and interactive elements within the app, enhancing visual appeal and engagement.
- The questionnaire is laid out to work on mobile, with good readability.
- Implement subtle animations, such as smooth transitions between questions and animated charts in the result presentation, to improve user experience.
